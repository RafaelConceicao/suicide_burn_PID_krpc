# suicide_burn_PID_krpc
Automated landing of KRPC rockets, especially the Falcon 9. Desired speed curves: a square root curve for altitudes above the intersection and a straight line for altitudes below the intersection. The PID controller may adjust the engine throttle to match the rocket's altitude vs. velocity curve to the desired altitude vs. velocity curve.
